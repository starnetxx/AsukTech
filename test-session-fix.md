# Session Persistence Fix - Testing Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Problematic Refresh Detection
- **Removed**: Logic that detected page refreshes and automatically logged out users
- **Fixed**: `App.tsx` and `AuthContext.tsx` refresh detection that was clearing sessions

### 2. Improved Session Restoration
- **Enhanced**: `getInitialSession()` function to properly restore user sessions
- **Fixed**: Race conditions between loading states and profile fetching
- **Removed**: Problematic 10-second failsafe timeout that was interfering

### 3. Better Auth State Management
- **Improved**: Auth state change handler to properly handle different events
- **Fixed**: Session loading and profile restoration flow
- **Enhanced**: Error handling for profile loading failures

### 4. Reduced Unnecessary Refreshes
- **Changed**: Visibility change handlers from 5 minutes to 30 minutes
- **Reduced**: Frequency of automatic data refreshes on app focus
- **Optimized**: Profile and data loading to prevent excessive API calls

### 5. Supabase Configuration
- **Enabled**: `autoRefreshToken: true` for proper session persistence
- **Maintained**: Session persistence in localStorage

## Testing Steps

1. **Login Test**:
   - Login to your account
   - Verify profile data loads (username, balance, etc.)
   - Check that dashboard shows correctly

2. **Refresh Test**:
   - After logging in, refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   - Verify that you remain logged in
   - Check that all user data persists (username, balance, etc.)
   - Confirm no automatic logout occurs

3. **Session Persistence Test**:
   - Login and close the browser tab
   - Open a new tab and navigate to the site
   - Verify you're still logged in with all data intact

4. **Multiple Refresh Test**:
   - Perform multiple page refreshes in succession
   - Ensure session remains stable throughout

## Expected Behavior

✅ **After Login**: User data should load and display correctly
✅ **After Refresh**: User should remain logged in with all data intact
✅ **Session Persistence**: Login state should persist across browser sessions
✅ **No Auto-Logout**: Page refresh should NOT trigger automatic logout
✅ **Data Integrity**: Username, balance, and other profile data should persist

## Console Messages to Look For

- ✅ "Found existing session for: [email]"
- ✅ "Profile loaded successfully from existing session"
- ❌ Should NOT see: "Page reloaded, clearing all app data"
- ❌ Should NOT see: "User is authenticated and page was refreshed, triggering logout"

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear browser cache and cookies completely
2. Try in an incognito/private browser window
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. Verify network connectivity to Supabase

The session persistence should now work correctly without losing user data on page refresh.
